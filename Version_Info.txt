                     ~Updating to repo~
               | --------------------------- |
               | v# : Short Version Title    |
               | Description: v# description |
               | --------------------------- |

----------------------------    ----------------------------   ------------------------- ------------------------------
v0 Continuation & README.md Update: This is a continuation of respo Python_Machine_Learning, this respo will just hold the image detection using
                    machine learning, and will build upon it. While the respo Python_Machine_Learning, will hold the general
                    but in-depth info for ML & other A.I advancements. For in-depth/detailed they will have their own
                    respo but connects to Python_Machine_Learning and possibile other future respos depending on the
                    information/what is being done for the project at the moment.

v1 I See Now: Image detection import tensorflow & req info test -> complete, begin operation of I See Now

v2 Update IC_Now: Updated info IC_now, included source code, image folder to place after images has been read/anaylz
                        on probability of that obj being that obj.
                        To make this program to work proprly you need to have
                        resnet50_coco_best_v2.0.1.h5
                        download link: https://github.com/olafenwaMoses/imageAI/releases/download/1.0/resnet50_coco_best_v2.0.1.h5
                        make sure the file resnet50_coco_best_v2.0.1.h5 is by your requirements.txt.

                        Will have to work on finding a proper solution to upload large files that are above 100MB.


v3 IC_Now Info: Updated ic_now.py to include colors.py & modified it to include safegaurds just in case wrong info has
                    been inputed / tell the user of the info & tell them the location of where it needs to be looked @.
                    modified error prints for updated lines.

v4 Fixed README: fixed README.md info

v5 Try/Except Custom File: User can now type in the file they want the computer to scan, and read the info
                            afterwords the completed images will be sent to folder image_detection_complete with the format
                            of imgname.jpg_img_complete to signify to the user the computer has finished scanning the
                            photo for data & is ready to be seen by a human to see the image probability.


v6 Credit: ~ Special Thanks to Kalob Taulien for the tutorial @ skillshare
                    link: https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Create-an-Image-Detection-App-from-Scratch-using-Machine-Learning/2083501919
                    learned a good summary of image recog, would recommend if your planning to go deeper into ML ^_^~

                    Will continue to work on this image reco program, and make it a bit more in-depth to aquire more info
                     such as getting tortiose/other obj to be recognized by the program. This is a new beginning and its
                     awesome!

--v6.6 Credit Edit: updated ic_now @ line 38-39 to include link to help anybody that is interested to further learn more
                    about listing files/being able to print them out for the user to see and type in the info to be used
                    for the computer image detection program.
