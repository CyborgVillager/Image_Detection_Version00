                     ~Updating to repo~
               | --------------------------- |
               | v# : Short Version Title    |
               | Description: v# description |
               | --------------------------- |

----------------------------    ----------------------------   ------------------------- ------------------------------
v0 Continuation & README.md Update: This is a continuation of respo Python_Machine_Learning, this respo will just hold the image detection using
                    machine learning, and will build upon it. While the respo Python_Machine_Learning, will hold the general
                    but in-depth info for ML & other A.I advancements. For in-depth/detailed they will have their own
                    respo but connects to Python_Machine_Learning and possibile other future respos depending on the
                    information/what is being done for the project at the moment.

v1 I See Now: Image detection import tensorflow & req info test -> complete, begin operation of I See Now

v2 Update IC_Now: Updated info IC_now, included source code, image folder to place after images has been read/anaylz
                        on probability of that obj being that obj.
                        To make this program to work proprly you need to have
                        resnet50_coco_best_v2.0.1.h5
                        download link: https://github.com/olafenwaMoses/imageAI/releases/download/1.0/resnet50_coco_best_v2.0.1.h5
                        make sure the file resnet50_coco_best_v2.0.1.h5 is by your requirements.txt.

                        Will have to work on finding a proper solution to upload large files that are above 100MB.


v3 IC_Now Info: Updated ic_now.py to include colors.py & modified it to include safegaurds just in case wrong info has
                    been inputed / tell the user of the info & tell them the location of where it needs to be looked @.
                    modified error prints for updated lines.

v4 Fixed README: fixed README.md info

v5 Try/Except Custom File: User can now type in the file they want the computer to scan, and read the info
                            afterwords the completed images will be sent to folder image_detection_complete with the format
                            of imgname.jpg_img_complete to signify to the user the computer has finished scanning the
                            photo for data & is ready to be seen by a human to see the image probability.


v6 Credit: ~ Special Thanks to Kalob Taulien for the tutorial @ skillshare
                    link: https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Create-an-Image-Detection-App-from-Scratch-using-Machine-Learning/2083501919?via=search-layout-grid
                    learned a good summary of image recog, would recommend if your planning to go deeper into ML ^_^~

                    Will continue to work on this image reco program, and make it a bit more in-depth to aquire more info
                     such as getting tortiose/other obj to be recognized by the program. This is a new beginning and its
                     awesome!

v6.6 Credit Edit: updated ic_now @ line 38-39 to include link to help anybody that is interested to further learn more
                    about listing files/being able to print them out for the user to see and type in the info to be used
                    for the computer image detection program.


v7 Updated: updated ic_now to include visual color when asking the user on what image they would like to scan.
               as stated in v6 will be working to update this program even further. Did some other tests on it, requires
               a bit more tweaking so it can scan a lot more objs, can only handle a few before the program ignores the
               other objs. Will work on the following:
               *allow the program to scan obj even if theres distortion, low quality photo, etc.
               *scan multiple obj that have a visual on the photo
               *make this automated using an a.i/save it on a db. -> prob be private depending on how
               large I get this program to be
               * Will add more later


v7.7 Tidy Up: removed import glob from ic_now.py, will be testing with glob in the near future
                link for more info: https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html

v7.8 Updated v6:  Updated Credit Link @ v6

v8 License Added: Added License

--v9 .git ignore: added git ignore for resnet50_coco_best_v2.0.1.h5 due to large file size
