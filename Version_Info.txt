               | v# : Short Version Title    |
               | Description: v# description |

v0 Continuation & README.md Update: This is a continuation of respo Python_Machine_Learning, this respo will just hold the image detection using
                    machine learning, and will build upon it. While the respo Python_Machine_Learning, will hold the general
                    but in-depth info for ML & other A.I advancements. For in-depth/detailed they will have their own
                    respo but connects to Python_Machine_Learning and possibile other future respos depending on the
                    information/what is being done for the project at the moment.

v1 I See Now: Image detection import tensorflow & req info test -> complete, begin operation of I See Now

v2 Update IC_Now: Updated info IC_now, included source code, image folder to place after images has been read/anaylz
                        on probability of that obj being that obj.
                        To make this program to work proprly you need to have
                        resnet50_coco_best_v2.0.1.h5
                        download link: https://github.com/olafenwaMoses/imageAI/releases/download/1.0/resnet50_coco_best_v2.0.1.h5
                        make sure the file resnet50_coco_best_v2.0.1.h5 is by your requirements.txt.

                        Will have to work on finding a proper solution to upload large files that are above 100MB.


v3 IC_Now Info: Updated ic_now.py to include colors.py & modified it to include safegaurds just in case wrong info has
                    been inputed / tell the user of the info & tell them the location of where it needs to be looked @.
                    modified error prints for updated lines.

--v4 Fixed README: fixed README.md info
